I'm going to the <a href="http://www.opensourcedays.org/">Open Source Days 2012</a> conference this weekend. This year's program is really interesting, and I'm looking forward to spend two days listening to geeky talks. The organizers have ask me to take the role as chairman. Saturday I will chair the session of web programming, but I'm not sure about Sunday.<br /><br />Actually, for me the conference began yesterday. I gave a full day course on JavaScript programming. It was really great to explains the language in details for a group of experience software developers. You can find my slides at <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/geisshirt/javascript-11922069">slide share</a>.
